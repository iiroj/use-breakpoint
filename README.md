A React hook (>=16.8) for getting the current responsive media breakpoint, successor to [breakpoint-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/breakpoint-observer).

## Usage

Initialize `useBreakpoint` with a configuration object, and optionally a default breakpoint name (in non-window environments like SSR). The return value will be an object with the breakpoint's name (`string`), min-width, and max-width values (`number`):

```javascript
import useBreakpoint from 'use-breakpoint';

/**
 * It is important to bind the object of breakpoints to a variable for memoization to work correctly.
 * If they are created dynamically, try using the `useMemo` hook.
 */
const BREAKPOINTS = { mobile: 0, tablet: 768, desktop: 1280 }

const CurrentBreakpoint = () => {
  const { breakpoint, maxWidth, minWidth } = useBreakpoint(BREAKPOINTS, 'desktop');
  return <p>The current breakpoint is {breakpoint}!</p>;
};
```

### Return values

Given a configuration `BREAKPOINTS = { mobile: 0, tablet: 768, desktop: 1280 }` and a window size of `1280x960`, the hook will return as the breakpoint:

1. `const { breakpoint } = useBreakpoint(BREAKPOINTS)`
    - `undefined` when rendered server-side
    - `'desktop'` when rendered client-side
1. `const { breakpoint } = useBreakpoint(BREAKPOINTS, 'mobile')`
    - `'mobile'` when rendered server-side
    - `'mobile'` on the first client-side render
    - `'desktop'` on subsequent client-side renders
1. `const { breakpoint } = useBreakpoint(BREAKPOINTS, 'mobile', false)`
    - `'mobile'` when rendered server-side
    - `'desktop'` when rendered client-side

### Hydration

If supplied a default breakpoint, the hook will always return that value when rendered server-side. To not cause inconsistencies during the first client-side render, the default value is also used client-side for the first render, instead of the (possibly different) real breakpoint.

For example, given a breakpoint config:

```ts
const { breakpoint } = useBreakpoint(BREAKPOINTS, 'mobile')
```

When rendered server-side, `breakpoint === 'mobile'` always, because there is no window.

On client-side with a `desktop`-sized window, on the first render `breakpoint === 'mobile'`, and then on following renders `breakpoint === 'desktop'`.

This is to ensure `ReactDOM.hydrate` behaves correctly.

To disable this behavior, pass `false` as the third argument:

```ts
const { breakpoint } = useBreakpoint(BREAKPOINTS, 'mobile', false)
```

Now `breakpoint === 'mobile'` server-side, but `breakpoint === 'desktop'` client-side during the first render. You should probably use `ReactDOM.render` instead of `ReactDOM.hydrate` in this case.

## Functionality

This hook uses the [window.matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) functionality to calculate the current breakpoint. For a list of breakpoints, we generate some css media queries in the form of `(min-width: XXXpx) and (max-width: YYYpx)` and then add listeners for the changes. `useBreakpoint` will then update its return value when the breakpoint changes from one rule to another.

## Developing

This project is built with [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). A [Storybook](http://storybook.js.org/) is included for local previewing. The easiest way to get started is cloning the repo and starting the storybook server locally via `npm start`.
